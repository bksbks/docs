Bridge Network
-------------
The default network mode in Docker. It creates a private network between the host and containers, allowing containers to communicate with each other and with the host system.

Host Network
------------
This mode allows containers to share the host system's network stack, providing direct access to the host system's network

Overlay Networking
------------------
This mode enables communication between containers across multiple Docker host machines, allowing containers to be connected to a single network even when they are running on different hosts.


Macvlan Networking
------------------
This mode allows a container to appear on the network as a physical host rather than as a container.
